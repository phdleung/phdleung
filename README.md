- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedro Leung, a Full Stack Developer (WIP... 😉)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, .NET Core, NodeJS and a bunch of other technologies at @april9-digital-consulting
- 👴🏻 I used to work with SAP MII, ExtJS and other stuff for a long time, but now I am looking for different things to learn!
- 📫 Have a look on my Linkedin to see my old and new experiences! Feel free to reach me out on @pedrohdleung
